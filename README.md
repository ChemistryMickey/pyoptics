# Pyoptics
An library for 2D matrix optics for Python.

For 2D Ray and Gaussian optics, optical elements (e.g. lenses, free-space propagation, refraction, etc) can be mathematically substituted with a 2x2 matrix.

Propagation of a ray or a beam through that optical system can be modeled as a simple matrix multiplication on a couple parameters which define the ray or Gaussian beam.
